The following project consists of a single C++ file which is the implementation of the L\+SH algorithm in the C++ language.~\newline
 The input file used for testing was a file with D\+NA sequences.~\newline
 The user inputs the shingle size, the number of hash functions to be used, the size of a band, and the threshold (percentage) above which strings are considered to be similar.~\newline
 The user then inputs the query string.~\newline
 The program outputs the D\+NA sequences which are similar to the query string based on the inputs given.~\newline
